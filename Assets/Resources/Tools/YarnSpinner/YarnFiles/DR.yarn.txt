%“I’d be happy to oblige you.”
<<ChangePortrait Portrait UI_Portrait_Laura>>
->“How is life on Mars?”
    <<ChangePortrait Portrait UI_Portrait_DR>>
    %“Mars is the best!” The doctor's eyes really light up when he starts talking about his home planet. “You’ll find that experienced workers will never have a hard time finding work, and what I’ve read about you in your rapport, you shouldn’t have a hard time fitting in. We have everything anyone could ever need. You should see the agricultural zones, algae farmers on earth wouldn’t believe their eyes, we have fields of crops and even grazing cattle. You would love it! Nothing beats the mornings as the sun climbs over the red Martian landscape. It not just the beauty of the planet itself, there is calm or stillness that doesn’t exist here on Earth. All I have to do is close my eyes to see the rounded domes of Prime City.”

->“The trip to Mars... how long is it?”
    <<ChangePortrait Portrait UI_Portrait_DR>>
    %“It’s not as it used to be back in the days. A one way trip won’t take more than a couple of weeks. It might feel longer than it really is, boredom would probably be your greatest enemy. Mmm… Let’s just say you will have a lot of free time to exercise and read up on books. If you never have been in space, it will be quite the experience.”

->“Why is the MSA forcing me to leave my daughter?”
    <<ChangePortrait Portrait UI_Portrait_DR>>
    %“You should be happy that you have been chosen. There aren’t that many people that are allowed to go to Mars, and I’m personally not forcing anyone to go Ms. Lynn.” The doctor pauses for a moment, to collect his thoughts. “If you like... I could speak to my superiors, and see if they could help you in any way.” 
    <<ChangePortrait Portrait UI_Portrait_Laura>>
    ¤“Thank you Dr. Aurum! That would mean the world to me. I hate to bother you but could I ask you another question?”
    [[DR_Mars]]

->“Could you tell me what made me viable to go?”
    <<ChangePortrait Portrait UI_Portrait_DR>>
    %“Good question! Your DNA was found free from from most hereditary diseases, it was also found in the interview that you are above average in intelligence, and that your skillset is adaptable for work conditions on Mars.” Dr. Aurum clears his throat and looks a bit embarrassed  “Your physiology... also showed a promising match with many of our other citizens, and you are not to old to bear more children.”
    [[DR_Screening]]
->“How come my daughter wasn’t deemed ‘good enough’?”
    <<ChangePortrait Portrait UI_Portrait_DR>>
    %“She’s not sick, if that’s what you're thinking.” He reassures Laura. “Yet she has a some genetic predispositions likely acquired from her father, since we couldn’t find any traces of them in you, that makes her a future risk for the populace of Mars. We could probably treat it, or we could even chemically castrate her, but it has been decided that no chances are to be taken when it comes to genetic diseases.” 
    [[DR_Screening]]
->“Isn’t it possible that there was an error during the screening process?”
    <<ChangePortrait Portrait UI_Portrait_DR>>
    %“Hmpf! I find that unlikely, but the possibility is there. Trials have shown that quick screenings have a 1% chance of failure.” Doctor Aurums eyes narrow as he continues to speak “I can see where you’re going with this, but no, we aren’t going to redo the screening on your daughter. The unlikely chance of failure makes it a waste of time and resources.”

%“Yes, indeed! People here doesn’t seem to realise how much this injection would be able to improve their life. A shame really. We had hoped for a greater turn up, but so far we have only inoculated 10% of the expected subjects, and as the martian medical delegation been recommended not to stray too far away from the Enforcers and the relative security of the gates, we haven’t really been able to reach the most promising patients. Are you interested in assisting us with the inoculations?”
<<ChangePortrait Portrait UI_Portrait_Laura>>
->“Yes, I think I can help you. I know a lot of people around the hovels, so it shouldn't be a problem.”
    <<ChangePortrait Portrait UI_Portrait_DR>>
    %“Superb! I believe there is a kit lying around here somewhere.” The doctor rummages through his med. station, looking for something “Ah! Here are ten vials.” Aurum gives you a vaccination kit and something that looks like a weird gun. “Just give a patient a shot from this jet injector in the shoulder, and remember to reload the injector with a new vial for each patient. Good luck Ms. Lynn and I’ll see you after you have completed your assignment!”

    %Doctor Aurum sighs, he looks drained of energy and mutters under his breath “It seems getting good help here is even harder than I would have expected.” Then he speaks up “Farewell Ms. Lynn! ...I’ll see you on the ship.”
->“Not at the moment.”
    <<ChangePortrait Portrait UI_Portrait_DR>>
    %“Too bad!” The doctor looks a bit disappointed, but continues with a hint of hope. “The opportunity to assist the MSA will remain for some additional days to come. Should you have a change of heart, you’ll find us here. I hope to see you again Ms. Lynn!”

        %“Excellent Ms. Lynn! It seems you’re quite a valuable asset to the MSA.” The doctor looks content with your effort just before he starts patting his lab coat and looking a bit confused. “I could have sworn I put it somewhere around here… Ah!” He pulls out a keycard and gives it to you. “This keycard gives you access to the projects. The MSA have other medical facilities there that need assistance from competent individuals like yourself. Good day Ms. Lynn!”

->“Excuse me, I didn’t mean to bother you.”
